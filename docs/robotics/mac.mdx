## Hardware

For the Mac Mini, add a 12V input to the power rail. You can figure this out yourself, or, find instructions on YouTube.

## Apple Remote Desktop

Apple Remote Desktop is a good solution for developing, except that the audio is routed to your development computer and there is no good way to unmute the sound when you stop ARD.

**Solution** - Stop RD, and then connect via SSH, and run the "test_audio_mac.py" script to unmute after stopping RD. 

**Update** - the Mac will automatically unmute the default audio device once the ARD session is terminated.

## FileVault / Auto Connect to Wifi

FileVault blocks auto connect to WiFi, making it impossible to remote connect to your Mac after it boots (unless you have a screen/keyboard connected to it).

**Solution** - turn off FileVault, or, do not provide AppleID credentials, in which case FileVault will be off by default.
