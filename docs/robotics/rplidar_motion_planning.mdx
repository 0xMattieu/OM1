## RPLidar

This is an A8.

```bash
ls /dev/tty.*  
ls /dev/cu.*  
uv run rptest.py /dev/cu.usbserial-0001 # for example
```

Please configure as needed: 

```python
"""
Robot and sensor configuration
"""
half_width_robot      = 0.20  # the width of the robot is 40 cm
max_relevant_distance = 1.1   # meters
sensor_mounting_angle = 180.0 # corrects for how sensor is mounted
```

## Architecture 

The system pre-computes 9 different paths, 4 to the left, one straight ahead, 4 to the right, and one to the back. For each of the those Bezier curves, the code checks whether the path approaches any detected object to within `half_width_robot`. If not, the path is considered to be a valid choice and the motion system can execute that path. 

## Assumptions

The code assumes that any unpredictable barriers (e.g. humans crossing the path of the robot) will be avoided using separate code within the `action` driver, such as by issuing a "STOP" command when an object is detected in front of the robot.   

## Unitree Test System 

Run
```bash
uv run src/run.py unitree_go2_lidar
```
