## Hardware

A simple solution for outdoors localization and basic navigation is an Arduino board (such as the Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Sense) with a GPS shield (such as the Adafruit Ultimate GPS FeatherWing). The sense provides a microcontroller, Bluetooth, a 6DoF IMU, and a magnetometer (a LIS3MDL). The FeatherWing shield provides a GPS.

## Assembly

Solder the FeatherWing to the Adafruit Sense. Add support for the [Adafruit nRF52](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-bluefruit/arduino-support-setup) to the Arduino IDE. Then add the board - it's the `Adafruit nRF52840 Sense`. The Arduino IDE will probably need to install the nRF core library (`adafruit:nrf52@1.6.1`). You should now be able to connect to the board.  

Then, use the Arduino IDE to write a simple script to stream GPS and magnetometer data though the USB/serial. An example is given next. 

## Software

To the Arduino IDE, add the following libraries:

* `Adafruit GPS library`
* `Adafruit LIS3MDL`
* `Adafruit_LSM6DS`

Run the sketch in `/system_hw_test/gps_mag`. It yields all the data for tilt compensated magnetic heading and a GPS location (as well as altitude and velocity).
