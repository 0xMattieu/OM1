OM1 connects to TurtleBot4 using Zenoh. To correctly set up your TurtleBot4, follow these steps.

1. Set up your TurtleBot4 following the [Basic Setup](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/setup/basic.html). These instructions are for `turtlebot4_standard_humble_1.0.4.img`, but should work for any current TurtleBot4 image. Please spend some time to become familiar with the Turtlebot4 ecosystem - there are extensive educational materials to help you get started. 

2. There are numerous issues connecting to a TurtleBot4 in a university/enterprise network. To solve many of those, set up a Zenoh bridge. To avoid routing isseus, make the following changes to the Turtlebot4.

Use the `turtlebot4-setup` tool to access `ROS Setup:Bash Setup` and set it to the following:

```bash
ROBOT_NAMESPACE=/pi
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
CYCLONEDDS_URI=[] # Empty
```
Click "Save", "Esc", and then "Apply Settings". 

Then, access the Create3's App config page at its web server (e.g. `192.168.1.193:8080/ros-config`). Change the ROS_DOMAIN_ID to `1`, or any other number exzcept `0`. Click `Save` and _Restart Application_. 

Then, on the Raspberry Pi command line, download and install the standalone `zenoh-bridge-ros2dds` bridge:

```bridge
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://download.eclipse.org/zenoh/debian-repo/ /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zenoh-bridge-ros2dds.
```

Finally, run the bridge on the Rasberry Pi command line:

```bash
zenoh-bridge-ros2dds
```

The TurtleBot4 will now discover other computers running Zenoh, send then Zenoh messages, and also, accept Zenoh messages and forward them to ROS2.

3. On the TurtleBot4, test the system:

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 action list
ros2 topic echo /pi/scan
```

4. Install Zenoh on your Mac, PC, or Linux computer, following [Installing the Zenoh router](https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Congratuations! You can now control a TurtleBot4 from your Mac laptop, using OM1 and Zenoh.
