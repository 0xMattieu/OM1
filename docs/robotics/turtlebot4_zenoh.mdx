OM1 connects to TurtleBot4 using Zenoh. To correctly set up your TurtleBot4, follow these steps.

1. Set up your TurtleBot4 following the [Basic Setup](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/setup/basic.html). These instructions are for `turtlebot4_standard_humble_1.0.4.img`, but should work for any current TurtleBot4 image. Please spend some time to become familiar with the Turtlebot4 ecosystem - there are extensive educational materials to help you get started. 

2. There are numerous issues connecting to a TurtleBot4 is university/enterprise network. To solve all of those, set up a [Zenoh Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmK2I0D5sas). The docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/theconstructai/zenoh-bridge-ros2dds). We suggest using `pi` and `c3` as the namespaces for the Raspberry Pi and the Create3, respectively, so it's clear where data are coming from. After you are done with the setup, your TurtleBot4 will be set up as follows:
```
Raspberry Pi configuration (use turtlebot4-setup tool):

RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
CYCLONEDDS_URI=[] (Empty).
Any namespace can be added, such as "pi"
Create 3 configuration (Access web server in a browser: 192.168.1.XX:8080):

RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1
Uncheck Use ROS Discovery Server.
Any namespace can be added, such as "c3"
```

WiFi will be handled by the Raspberry Pi.   

Starting the Zenoh bridge
```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
Terminal access and other useful commands into the bridge:
```bash
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker attach fef7aa4ad033
sudo docker exec -it fef7aa4ad033 sh # change the CONTAINER ID
```

3. On the TurtleBot4, test the system:

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 action list
ros2 topic echo /pi/scan
```

4. Install Zenoh on your Mac, PC, or Linux computer, following [Installing the Zenoh router](https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Start the Zenoh daemon from inside `/OM1/system_hw_test` using:

```bash
zenohd --config=zenho_config.json5
```

## Accessing TurtleBot4 Data on a remote computer using Zenoh



Reading Scan Data:
```bash
uv run system_hw_test/turtlebot4_laserscan.py
```

Front video feed:
```bash
uv run system_hw_test/go2_camera_opencv.py en0
```

Front video single image:
```bash
uv run system_hw_test/go2_capture_image.py en0
```

Lowstate system/joint data:
```bash
uv run system_hw_test/go2_data_stream.py en0
```
