## Basic Commands 

Run
```bash Run Robot
uv run src/run.py turtlebot4
```

## Idendity and Keys

**API_KEY** Go to [portal](portal.openmind.org) to get a free API key. Enter this API key in the "api_key" field in the `/config/turtlebot4.json5` file. You can also provide this API key via your .env - just enter it as:

```bash
OM_API_KEY=om1_live_e4252f1cf005af...
``` 

**UNIVERSAL_ROBOT_ID (URID)** Go to ["Hello Robots, come join us"](https://portal.openmind.org/robots) to join a decentralized machine<>machine coordination and communication system (FABRIC). Enter machine metadata - currently an arbitrary string - and click "join". The system will provide a unique URID for your robot. The URIDs all share the same format: they begin with `OM`, then 12 alphanumeric characters (numerals and letters), adding up to 14 characters in total. They're not case sensitive. A unique URID allows multiple robots to communicate with one another, similar to how humans use different phone numbers to help them communicate and coordinate. 

Enter the URID in the "URID" field in the `/config/turtlebot4.json5` file. You can also provide the URID via your .env - just enter it as:

```bash
URID=OM742d35Cc6634 # yours will be different!
``` 

## Suggested Operating System Versions

The TurtleBot4 contains two entirely separate computers, the Raspberry Pi (RPi) and the Create3. These computers are accessed in different ways, run different software, and have different roles. Different combinations of software versions running on those computers give somewhat differing capabilities.  

**Raspberry Pi**\
Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-1073-raspi aarch64)\
[turtlebot4_standard_humble_1.0.4.img (2024-08-19 16:59 2.2G)](http://download.ros.org/downloads/turtlebot4/turtlebot4_standard_humble_1.0.4.zip)

Suitable images can be installed via a [flashed SD card](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/setup/basic.html). Note that instructions given are needlessly complex - basically, download the image, unzip it, flash a SD card with that image using your favorite tool/platform (`dd`, `dcfldd`, whatever you prefer), insert the flashed SD card into the RPi, and turn it on.

**Create3**\
[H.2.6 (Humble)](https://github.com/iRobotEducation/create3_docs/releases/download/H.2.6/Create3-H.2.6.swu)

## Set Up

OM1 connects to TurtleBot4 using Zenoh. To correctly set up your TurtleBot4, follow these steps.

1. Set up your TurtleBot4 following the [Basic Setup](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/setup/basic.html). Please then become familiar with the Turtlebot4 ecosystem - there are extensive educational materials to help you get started. If you are not familiar with the TurtleBot4, please see the excellent [documentation](https://turtlebot.github.io/turtlebot4-user-manual/). 

NOTE: Please update the Raspberry Pi's OS (use `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`).

NOTE: Please update the TurtleBot4's internal Create3 computer to `iRobot® Create® 3 Release H.2.6` via the Create3's html "Update" page.

NOTE: Make sure to remember the TurtleBots' IP address in your local network. If you do not know it, scan your local network for "Raspberry Pi". 

NOTE: In the remainder of this writeup, we assume you are generally familiar with the ROS2/Turtlebot4 ecosystem, including ssh-ing to the Raspberry Pi command line, the use of the `turtlebot4-setup` program, and interacting with the internal Create3 via its webpage at IP:8080. 

2. As you have just experienced first-hand, there are numerous issues connecting to a TurtleBot4 in a university/enterprise network. To solve many of those, we follow the dual Zenoh bridge approach developed by [theconstruct.ai](www.theconstruct.ai), which is to give the Raspberry Pi and the Create3 their own ROS2 DOMAIN_IDs, and then use Zenoh bridges to filter message traffic between the RPi and the Create3. This allows you to filter messages on a per topic level (see the `config_create3.json5` file for an example of how this is done).

Make the following `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` changes to the TurtleBot4. Use the `turtlebot4-setup` tool to access `ROS Setup:Bash Setup` and set it to the following:

```bash
ROBOT_NAMESPACE=/_your_robots_URID_/pi 
# example: ROBOT_NAMESPACE=/OM742d35Cc6634/pi
ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
CYCLONEDDS_URI=[] # Empty
```

Click "Save", "Esc", and then "Apply Settings". The TurtleBot4 will reboot. Once the reboot is complete (wait for chime, 1 min), access the Create3's App config page at its web server (e.g. `192.168.1.XXX:8080/ros-config`). Change the ROS_DOMAIN_ID to 1. The correct settings are:

```
ROS 2 Domain ID (default 0): 1
ROS 2 Namespace: /_your_robots_URID_/c3 
# example: /OM742d35Cc6634/c3
RMW_IMPLEMENTATION: rmv_cyclonedds_cpp
```

Note the use of the "/c3" to create an unique namespace for the c3. 

Click `Save` and _Restart Application_. 

NOTE: Do not forget to click _Restart Application_, otherwise the changes will not be applied. Wait for chime (1 min) indicating Create3 reboot. 

Finally, on the TurtleBot4's RPi, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/raspberry-pi-os/) and run `sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d`. The `docker-compose` should be:

```bash docker-compose.yaml
services:
  zenoh-bridge-turtlebot4:
    image: openmindagi/turtlebridge
    container_name: zenoh-bridge-turtlebot4
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: always # Ensures the container restarts on reboot
```

The TurtleBot4 will now be more stable, can discover other computers running Zenoh, send them Zenoh messages, and also, accept Zenoh messages and forward them to ROS2.

3. On the TurtleBot4 command line, test the system:

```bash
ros2 topic list
ros2 action list
ros2 topic echo /$URID/pi/scan
```

To spin the robot, on the TurtleBot4 command line issue:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /$URID/c3/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "linear:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.1"
```

To debug movement, use `ros2 topic info /$URID/pi/cmd_vel --verbose`.

4. Install Zenoh on your Mac, PC, or Linux box, following [Installing the Zenoh router](https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Please make sure that your development machine (e.g. your laptop) is running the same version of the Zenoh bridge (e.g. 1.2.1) as the RPi otherwise you will get errors.

Congratulations! You can now interact with a TurtleBot4 from your laptop, using OM1 and Zenoh.

## Interacting with TurtleBot4 from a Remote Computer using Zenoh

Steer the TurtleBot4 with your keyboard:
```bash
cd system_hw_test
uv run turtlebot4_keyboard_movement.py
```
* W - Move Forward
* S - Move Backward
* A - Turn Left
* D - Turn Right

Read TurtleBot4 laser scan, collision, and battery data:
```bash
cd system_hw_test
uv run turtlebot4_laserscan.py
```

Read TurtleBot4 Camera PREVIEW (250x250RGB) data:
```bash
cd system_hw_test
uv run turtlebot4_camera_opencv.py
```

## Expected ROS2 Topics for a Correctly Configured System

On the TurtleBot4 command line, run `ros2 topic list`. Topics with a `pi` prefix originate from the RPi, and topics without a prefix are from the Create3. If you do not see any non-prefixed topics, your Create3 is not talking correctly to the RPi.
