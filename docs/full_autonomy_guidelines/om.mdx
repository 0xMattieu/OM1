OM1 is the core agentic software that enables autonomous decision-making and control for your robot. It runs as a dedicated Docker image, making deployment and integration straightforward.
Full autonomy is currently supported for Go2.

## Get started

### SSH into your robot

- Identify the ip address
- SSH into the system using ssh username@ip_address (Replace username with your username)
- Use the password provided to you, when prompted

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenMind/OM1.git
```

### Find Unitree Ethernet port
```bash
ifconfig
```
Find the port with ip address `192.168.123.x`. Note down the port name and update it in "unitree_go2_autonomy_advance.json5".

```bash
vim config/unitree_go2_autonomy_advance.json5
```

```bash
  "hertz": 1,
  "unitree_ethernet": "eno1", // update here
  "name": "bits",
```

### Setup the API key

For Bash: vim ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.

Add 
```bash 
export OM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

### Setup default speaker and microphone
- Connect your robot with a microphone and a speaker if not already connected.
- Install pulseaudio, if not already installed
```bash
sudo apt install pulseaudio
```

- Find the available devices using following commands -
    - for speakers 
    ```bash
    pactl list sinks
    ```
    - for microphone
    ```bash
    pactl list sources
    ```
    Make a note of the device names.

- To set the default the speaker and mircophone:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
vim ~/.config/systemd/user/audio-defaults.service
```

And add

```bash
# Load the default configuration
[Unit]
Description=Set Default Audio Devices
After=pulseaudio.service
Wants=pulseaudio.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'sleep 5 && pactl set-default-sink {sink_name} && pactl set-default-source {source_name}'

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Reboot the system.

Note : Replace sink and source names based on what you found in the previous step.

### Docker image

Install docker/docker-compose if not already installed.

Update the docker-compose file. Replace "unitree_go2_autonomy_advance" with the agent you want to run.
```bash
command: ["unitree_go2_autonomy_advance"]
```

The OM1 service is provided as a Docker image for easy setup:
```bash
cd OM1
docker-compose up om1 -d --no-build
```

This image contains all necessary dependencies and configuration for running OM1.

## Role in the System

- Receives sensor and mapping data from other services.
- Processes information and issues commands for movement and interaction.
